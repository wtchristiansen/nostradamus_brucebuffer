MMA Fight Outcome Prediction Script
Overview
This script is designed for predicting outcomes of MMA fights using a combination of machine learning and Bayesian statistical models. It includes data preparation, model training, prediction, and visualization steps. The core functionalities include handling imbalanced datasets, training Random Forest models, and performing Bayesian analysis to estimate fight outcomes.

Prerequisites
R (Version 3.6 or later)
RStudio (Recommended for ease of use)
Required R Packages
The script utilizes several R packages for data manipulation, model building, and visualization:

tidyverse for data manipulation and visualization
caret for machine learning workflow
pROC for ROC curve analysis
ggplot2 for advanced graphing
doParallel for parallel processing
brms for Bayesian regression modeling
ROSE for handling imbalanced datasets
Installation
Before running the script, ensure all required packages are installed. The script includes a section that checks for missing packages and attempts to install them if they are not already installed on your system.

r
Copy code
packages <- c("tidyverse", "caret", "pROC", "ggplot2", "doParallel", "brms", "ROSE", "doParallel")
sapply(packages, function(pkg) {
  if (!require(pkg, character.only = TRUE, quietly = TRUE)) {
    install.packages(pkg, dependencies = TRUE)
    library(pkg, character.only = TRUE)
  }
})
Script Features
Data Preparation: Includes data loading, cleaning, and preprocessing steps.
Handling Imbalanced Data: Utilizes the ROSE package to oversample the minority class in the dataset.
Model Training: Trains a Random Forest model using the caret package.
Bayesian Analysis: Performs Bayesian regression modeling using the brms package.
Prediction and Visualization: Provides functions to manually enter fighter stats, predict fight outcomes, and visualize the predictions.
Usage
Data Preparation: Ensure your data is in the correct format as specified in the script comments. Adjust the path to your dataset accordingly.
Model Training: The script will automatically train a machine learning model using the prepared data. It also sets up parallel processing to speed up the computation.
Making Predictions: Use the predict_fight function to make predictions on fight outcomes. You can manually input fighter stats if they are not available in the dataset.
Visualization: Utilizes ggplot2 for visualizing the predicted probabilities and confidence intervals. Bayesian analysis results are visualized using bayesplot.
